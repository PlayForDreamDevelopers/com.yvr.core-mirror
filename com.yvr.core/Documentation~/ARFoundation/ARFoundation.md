# AR Foundation
Using `AR Foundation` enables the creation of cross-platform augmented reality applications. In an `AR Foundation` project, you can enable specific features by adding corresponding components to the scene.

## Features
- [Anchor](Anchor.md): Track arbitrary points in space.
- [Camera](Camera.md): Renders the image from the device's camera.
- [Mesh](Mesh.md): Detects and generates meshes of the spatial environment.
- [Plane](Plane.md): Identifies and tracks flat surfaces.

## Sample Project

Clone the official PFDM sample repository [ARFoundationSample-Unity](https://github.com/PlayForDreamDevelopers/ARFoundationSample-Unity/tree/main). The directory `Assets/ARFoundationSample` contains pre-adapted sample scenes for `AR Foundation`. You can directly compile and install them on PFDM devices to run.
