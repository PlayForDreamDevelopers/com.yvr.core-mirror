# Spatial Awareness

This section describes a series of ways provided by the SDK to enable applications to perceive the real physical environment:

-   [Passthrough](SpatialSensing/Passthrough.md): Real-time display of the real world through the camera
-   [Room Calibration](SpatialSensing/RoomCalibration.md): Obtain pre-calibrated room information through the SDK
-   [Spatial Mesh](SpatialSensing/SpatialMesh.md): Real-time acquisition of spatial mesh information from the real world
-   [Plane Detection](SpatialSensing/PlaneDetection.md): Real-time acquisition of large plane information in the real world
-   [Spatial Anchor](SpatialSensing/SpatialAnchor.md): Record positions in the real space by setting custom anchors
-   [Image Tracking](SpatialSensing/ImageTracking.md): Detecting and tracking 2D images in the environment
