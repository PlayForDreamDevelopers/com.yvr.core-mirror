# Supersampling and Sharpening

To improve image quality, you could enable supersampling or sharpening. This solves the issues like flickering and moir√© when downsampling, which further improves the image quality. Sharpening increases the image clarity and improves the blurring of image during upsampling. 


## Enable Supersampling Feature

Use Compositor Layer to select supersampling type:      

1. Under **Compositor Layer** settings, 
    <br />
    ![CompositorLayer](./SupersamplingAndSharpening/CompositorLayer.png)
    <br />
    select **Super Sampling Type**:
        - **None**
        - **Normal**
        - **Quality**


## Enable Sharpening Feature

Use YVR Manager or Compositor Layer to select sharpen type: 

1. Under **YVR Manager** settings, 
    <br />
    ![YVRManager](./SupersamplingAndSharpening/YVRManager.png)
    <br />
    select **Sharpen Type**:
        - **None**
        - **Normal**
        - **Quality**


## Note

- When using sharpening, please enable multi-layer mipmap for the requested swapchain and generate texture data for each of its mipmap layers before committing.
- In OpenXR, all settings are recommended only and the compositor can enable or disable them as needed.
- Compositing layer filtering requires more GPU resources. This is especially true for sharpening and supersampling algorithms, where you should weigh the increased visual fidelity against the additional GPU resources needed to provide the best VR user experience.


## Example

View the sample project for your reference.

1. Open a new project or current project.

2. Import the latest SDK. 

3. Under Project panel, select **Pacakages** > **YVR Core** > **Scenes** > **CompositeLayer**.

4. Under CompositeLayer folder, select **CompositeLayerSuperSamplingSharpen.unity** to open the scene. 

5. Go to **File** > **Build Settings...**, select **Add Open Scenes**.

6. Select **Build** and name the file. 

7. Install the exported APK fie.
