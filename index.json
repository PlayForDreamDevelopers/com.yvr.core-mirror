    "title": "Application SpaceWarp | Core",
    "keywords": "Application SpaceWarp Application SpaceWarp (AppSW) is an optimization technique for developers that allows applications to render at half the actual display refresh rate, freeing up additional computing power for appropriate content. In testing, AppSW has been shown to provide up to 70% more computing power to applications with virtually no perceptible flaws. When developers turn on AppSW during the development and design phase, the system will extrapolate and re-project frames based on the motion vector and depth information of the original data in the application, and automatically synthesise one frame of the original rendered image into multiple new frames to reduce the original output frame rate of the device, lower the load and power consumption of the device, and ultimately break through the arithmetic limitations to achieve a more lifelike and better picture performance on YVR devices, which is close to that of PCVR. YVR devices can achieve more realistic and better image performance. Environment Requirements Device: YVR1 or YVR2 SDK Version: 2.4.0 and above System Version: 1.2.5.x Enable AppSW Refer to the following steps to enable AppSW feature. Clone the Unity-Graphics repository. Import the three package.json files. From the menu bar, select Window > Pacakge Manager > Add package from disk... and install the following packages: Core RP Library Shader Graph Universal RP If custom shader is used, you will need to add Motion Vector Pass to the shader of the AppSW object. Note There is no need to modify the shader if Lit or SimpleLit is used. Transparent ojects do not need to add Motion Vector Pass, only opaque objects requires to add it. Objects close to opaque (e.g. Alpha close to 1) can be added according to situation. From the menu bar, select Edit > Project Settings. From the left panel, select Player > Android settings > Other Settings. Under Rendering section, add Vulkan to Graphics APIs. From the menu bar, select Edit > Project Settings. From the left panel, select XR Plug-in Management > YVR, set the following settings: Check Use AppSW Select Multiview as Stereo Rendering Mode Enter the following code to enable AppSW. YVRManager.instance.SetAppSWEnable(true); Assuming your app frame rate is currently at 90fps, when AppSW is turned on, the app will render at 45fps, but achieving at 90fps. If you would like to compare the rendering effect of AppSW On + 45fps and AppSW Off + 45fps, under YVR Manager script, select Quality Manager > V Sync Count: K2. Known Issues When using the AppSW feature, your app may experience some rendering issues. Please refer to the following scenarios and instructions to resolve the issues: If the background within the scene is very clean and contains elements such as straight lines, grids, etc., AppSW may cause image distortion, e.g., distorted straight lines. If the image is distorted, keep debugging and adjusting the background until a satisfactory result is achieved. If the scene contains some high-speed rotating objects, distortion artefacts may appear around the objects when AppSW is turned on, which can be solved by reducing the rotation speed of the objects. If there are unexpected pauses in individual elements of the scene or ripples on the screen, this is generally due to inaccurate data in the motion vectors for the following reasons: If the motion vector buffer does not show the motion of a moving part of the scene, this can cause stutters because moving objects seem to stay in place in the composite frame. If the motion vector buffer shows motion in the motionless parts of the scene, ripples are created because stationary objects move in the composite frame."

    "title": "Composition Layers | Core",
    "keywords": "Composition Layers Composition Layers can segment all objects that need to be displayed to achieve purposes such as improving the clarity of specific objects. In the most traditional rendering mode, all objects in the scene will be rendered to the same texture (Eye Buffer), which will be processed by the system for ATW, distortion, composition, and finally displayed on the device screen. By using composition layer technology, specific objects in the scene can be rendered to a texture and handed over to the system for composition, thus reducing an extra texture sampling and improving the clarity of object rendering. It should be noted that composition layers are not omnipotent. Each composition layer will increase the composition overhead for the system. Therefore, when using composition layers, it is necessary to use them reasonably according to actual needs and device performance: It is recommended to use composition layers for objects that need to improve clarity, such as UI interfaces, text, etc. The number of composition layers should not be too many. Generally, the number of composition layers in a single scene should be controlled to about 4 layers. The depth value of the composition layer needs to be set reasonably to ensure that the content in the composition layer and the Eye Buffer will not cause incorrect occlusion effects. Types of Composition Layers Composition layers can be divided into two types based on their type: Overlay and Underlay: Overlay: The texture of the Overlay type composition layer is presented in front of the Eye Buffer by default. For objects that need to always appear in front of the Eye Buffer, such as cursors, the Overlay type composition layer can be used. Underlay: The texture of the Underlay type composition layer is presented behind the Eye Buffer. Since the Underlay layer relies on the alpha channel on the rendering target, after all objects in the scene are drawn to the Eye Buffer, you need to create a \"hole\" on the Eye Buffer to allow the Underlay texture to show through this \"hole\". For objects like UI interfaces that may be occluded by other objects in the Eye Buffer (such as UI being occluded by a controller), the Underlay type composition layer can be used. The composition depth can be used to distinguish between Overlay and Underlay types of composition layers: The depth value of the Eye Buffer is 0. The depth value of the Underlay type composition layer is less than 0. The depth value of the Overlay type composition layer is greater than 0. Shapes of Composition Layers The shape of the composition layer determines the display effect of the composition layer. There are three shapes of composition layers: Quad, Cylinder, and Equirect: Quad: A quadrilateral plane texture with four vertices, usually used to display text or information in the scene. Cylinder: A cylindrical texture with a cylindrical arc, usually used to display curved UI interfaces. If using Cylinder: The center of the Transform will be the center of the Cylinder, the size of the Transform will be the size of the Cylinder, and the size of the Transform in the Cylinder will be the global size (Global Scale). Among them, Z is the radius of the Cylinder, Y is the height of the Cylinder, and X/Z is the arc length of the Cylinder. The camera must be placed inside the inscribed sphere of the cylinder. If the camera approaches the surface of the inscribed sphere, the composition layer will not be displayed. Equirect: A spherical texture, usually used to display 360/180 panoramic textures. The Radius parameter is used to specify the radius of the cylinder. When set to 0 or positive infinity (1.0f/0.0f), it indicates an infinitely large radius. When the spherical radius is infinitely large, its display effect is like a skybox in an empty scene. The X parameter under Destination Rects is useless; the W parameter maps to the central angle, symmetrical about the central point coordinates (0, 0). Texture Types The objects processed by the composition layer are textures, which can be divided into three types: External Texture: The texture content is obtained from outside the Unity rendering context. In typical use cases, it is directly obtained from the Android Surface texture (e.g., Android player video texture). For scenarios such as video players, external textures need to be used. Dynamic Texture: The texture content will be updated at runtime, such as the RenderTexture image generated by the camera. Static Texture: The texture content will not be updated at runtime, such as static advertisement images in the scene. Textures For textures used in composition layers, the following settings can be made: Texture Rects After checking the Texture Rects checkbox, you can configure the parameters related to Source Rects and Destination Rects. If you choose to customize Source Rects and Destination Rects (i.e., select the Custom option), you need to ensure that the values of X, Y, W, and H are within the specified range: X: \\([0,1)\\), Y: \\([0,1)\\), W: \\((0,1]\\), H: \\((0,1]\\). Transparency The alpha parameter is used to set the transparency of the texture, with a value range of \\([0,1]\\). Examples The CompositeLayer scene is used to illustrate the effect of composition layers. The design of the composition layer is to improve the clarity of the flat UI. In the traditional rendering pipeline, the UI texture must first be rendered to the color buffer managed by Unity, and then the color buffer managed by Unity will be rendered to the screen buffer. When using composition layers, the target UI texture can be rendered directly by the local renderer. Therefore, distortion caused by sampling can be reduced. The following is a screenshot of running the CompositeLayer scene on a YVR device: Caution Since the composition layer is rendered by the native system of the YVR device, the content cannot be displayed in the Unity editor. The lower part is the interface rendered by the Unity Eye Buffer, and the upper part is rendered by the composition layer. The left part is a dynamic texture, and the right part is a static texture. The detailed differences between rendering with composition layers (upper part) and Unity Eye Buffer (lower part) are as follows: Caution Some dispersion can be seen in the detailed image, which is generated to offset the dispersion caused by the lens. Therefore, when using the device, not all dispersion will be seen. Composition Layer Example Please refer to the following example project. Open a new project or the current project. Import the latest SDK. In the Project panel, select Packages > YVR Core > Scenes > CompositeLayer. In the CompositeLayer folder, select CompositeLayer.unity to open the scene. In File > Build Settings..., select Add Open Scenes. Select Build and name the file. Install the APK file on the device. This scene shows the effects of different depth values, dynamic and static images. Shape and Rect Example Please refer to the following example project. Open a new project or the current project. Import the latest SDK. In the Project panel, select Packages > YVR Core > Scenes > CompositeLayer. In the CompositeLayer folder, select CompositeLayerShapeAndRect.unity to open the scene. In File > Build Settings..., select Add Open Scenes. Select Build and name the file. Install the APK file on the device. This scene shows the effects of shape switching, setting source rectangles, and destination rectangles. Underlay vs Overlay Since the native system needs to composite multiple layers, it needs to know the order of all layers. This order is determined by the depth of the composition layer. The depth of the Unity Eye Buffer is set to 0. All layers with a depth greater than 0 are called Overlay, and layers with a depth less than 0 are called Underlay. The bottom layer will be drawn first, followed by the Unity Eye Buffer, and finally the Overlay. Therefore, the Unity Eye Buffer will cover the Underlay, and the Overlay will cover the Eye Buffer. To make the Underlay display normally and not be completely covered, a hole needs to be created in the Unity Eye Buffer. The shader YVR/UnderlayPuncher is designed to generate such a hole: Tip The layer in the upper left corner of the example scene is Underlay."

    "title": "Screen Refresh Rate | Core",
    "keywords": "Screen Refresh Rate The screen refresh rate represents the number of times the screen refreshes per second. Typically, the screen refresh rate is the same as the maximum frame rate supported by the application. For example, when the screen refresh rate is 72 Hz, the maximum frame rate of the application is 72 FPS. The higher the screen refresh rate, the faster the screen refreshes, and the better the smoothness and stability of the picture. However, a high screen refresh rate can also affect device performance. When the application cannot reach the maximum refresh rate of the device, it may cause frame drops, stuttering, tearing, and latency issues. By default, we encourage applications to set the screen refresh rate to 90 Hz to provide a better user experience. Only set the screen refresh rate to 72 Hz under special circumstances, such as: Insufficient performance or excessive power consumption: You can use the real-time monitoring tool to monitor application performance and ensure that the application can handle a high screen refresh rate. For more details, refer to performance monitoring and analysis. When playing videos: If the video frame rate does not match the screen refresh rate, it may cause visual discontinuity and stuttering. For example, if the video is 24 Hz and the screen refresh rate is set to 90 Hz. Because the 24 Hz video frame rate cannot be evenly distributed at the 90 Hz refresh rate, each frame's display time on the screen will be different, resulting in visual stuttering. Therefore, it is recommended to switch to an appropriate screen refresh rate when playing videos. Setting the Screen Refresh Rate Set the screen refresh rate through YVRManager.instance.cameraRenderer.displayFrequency as shown below: YVRManager.instance.cameraRenderer.displayFrequency = 90; You can set the screen refresh rate at the application startup or dynamically adjust the screen refresh rate as needed during the application runtime. If you do not set the screen refresh rate, the default screen refresh rate is 90 Hz."

    "keywords": "Fixed Foveated Rendering Fixed Foveated Rendering (FFR) renders the edges of eye render texture at a lower resolution than the center, which reduce the GPU load due to the lower fragment shader requirements. Thus, contents with high fragment shader calculations will see the most performance benefit from using FFR. The level of FFR can be adjusted via YVRManager as the following image, the higher level will lead to lower GPU load but blurred result in the edge of eye render texture. FFR level can be modified per frame which means you can switch the FFR level according to the content in the run-runtime. However, the jump between different FFR levels may be noticeable, thus it is highly recommended change the FFR level while switching the scenes. Keep in mind that GPU performance improvement brought by FFR comes at the cost of reduction in the effect of the edges of the eye render textures. Thus, while using FFR, you should pay attention to the balance between visual quality and GPU performance. Warning FFR is not the silver bullet for GPU performance issues. Enable Dynamic FFR To enable dynamc FFR, select the Fixed Foveated Rendering Dynamic checkbox under YVR Manager settings."

    "title": "Focus Awareness | Core",
    "keywords": "Focus Awareness The focus awareness feature allows the system UI to overlay on XR applications, enabling users to interact with the system UI directly within the application without needing to exit it. Focus awareness is a system capability that developers can use without writing any code. When the user presses the Home button on the controller, the system will automatically display the system UI using the focus awareness feature. When the system UI appears, the application will lose focus. Developers need to listen for focus awareness events to handle the focus state correctly, such as: Pausing the game when focus is lost Stopping the rendering of the controller model when focus is lost (since the system will render its own hand/controller model for UI interaction in this state) The focus awareness-related events are as follows: Event Description YVRManager.instance.eventsManager.onFocusGained The application loses input focus. For example, when the application is running and the user presses the Home button on the controller, the system UI appears, and the application loses input focus. Developers can pause the game, disable user input (e.g., controller), or notify other online users that the user is not currently focused on the application. YVRManager.instance.eventsManager.onFocusLost The application gains input focus. This event is triggered when the system UI is closed. Developers can resume the game or enable user input at this time. Tip The focus state changes caused by focus awareness are not the same as the focus state changes provided by Unity by default. The former is specific to the focus awareness feature for XR applications, while the latter is based on the focus state of the application window. Therefore, developers should not rely directly on Unity's OnApplicationFocus method to handle focus awareness state changes."

    "keywords": "HMD/Controller Emulator HMD/Controller Emulator are tools that allow you to use a keyboard and mouse to simulate the behaviour of HMD/controller in Unity Editor, like translating, rotating and clicking. Warning HMD/Controller Emulators only works in Unity Editor mode. HMD Emulator While using HMD emulator, you can use keyboard to simulate HMD's translation, and use mouse to simulate HMD's rotation. The HMD emulator can be configured in the Unity Inspector window, the configurable parts are as follows: The Activate Keys are the keys to activate HMD emulator. When any one of the Activate Keys is pressed, the HMD emulator is activated. You can simulate the HMD's rotation in Yaw/Pitch axis by moving the mouse horizontally and vertically respectively. When the HMD emulator is activated, and you want to rotate the HMD in Roll axis, you need to press any one of the Roll Keys. After that, the horizontal moving of the mouse will rotate the HMD in Roll Axis, and the vertical moving of the mouse will have no effect. When the HMD emulator is activated, you can press the Translation Keys to translate the HMD. Under default configuration, keys W, S, A, D, Q, E lead to forward/backward/Left/Right/Up/Down respectively. The speed of translation and rotation can be configured by Rotation Sensitivity and Translation Sensitivity. After Reset HMD Pose On Release is toggled on, both the rotation and translation of HMD will be reset to 0,0,0 when the pressed Activate Keys is released. Controller Emulator While using Controller Emulator, you can use keyboard to simulate controllers' click action, and use mouse to simulate controllers' translation and rotation. The controller emulator can be configured in the Unity Inspector window, the configurable parts are as follows: The Activate Keys are the keys to activate controller emulator. When any one of the Activate Keys is being pressed, the controller emulator is activated. You can simulator the controller's translation using mouse. The Target Controller's screen position will be the same with the cursor position on the screen. When the controller emulator is activated, and you want to rotate the controller, you need to press any one of the Rotation Keys. After that, the horizontal moving of the mouse will rotate the Target Controller in Yaw Axis, and the vertical moving of the mouse will rotate the Target Controller in Pitch Axis. Important You cannot translate and rotate the controller through the simulator at the same time. Like the HMD emulator, the rotation speed can be configured by Rotation Sensitivity. However, because of the position of controller is determined by the position of the mouse cursor rather than the mouse movement, there is no concept about Translation Sensitivity in controller emulator. When the controller emulator is activated, press the key in Key Mapping will simulate the corresponding key of the controllers. Like in the default configuration, the press of Alpha 1 key on the keyboard will simulate the click down action of the Index Trigger key of the left controller."

    "keywords": "MultiView Stereo Rendering Tip Also known as Single Pass Stereo Rendering YVR Devices support Single Pass Stereo Rendering which reduces CPU load that is used to summit draw call. In typical stereo rendering, eye buffers for both eyes must be rendered in sequence which leads to double draw call. The multiview stereo rendering depends on MultiView Rendering features in OpenGL which allows draw calls to render to several layers of an array texture simultaneously. Thus, both content in left and right eye buffers can be drawn in single draw call, and the vertex shader can know what layer it is writing to, so the rendering result is still different for each eye buffer which ensures the stereo effect. Two steps are required to open a single pass in Unity with YVR SDK: Select Multiview as the Stereo Rendering Mode in YVR XR Plugin-in configure window. Caution Single pass stereo rendering required shader support, thus you need to modify your own custom shader in order to support single pass stereo rendering.

Through room calibration, the realism and stability of the virtual reality program can be improved to provide users with a more interactive and immersive experience. Users can calibrate the walls, doors, windows, tables, chairs, sofas and other objects in the real room through the room calibration application. Developers can obtain user-created calibration data via the SDK and use it in their own apps. Requirement SDK Version: Unity SDK 2.8.0 and above Device Model: YVR 2 System Version: DreamOS 1.3.0 and above Calibration Data Permissions The room information and calibration data created by the room calibration app can be obtained through the SDK APIs and used in your own app, or you can create your own anchors within the app. Note Data modification permission: third-party apps cannot create rooms, only room calibration apps are allowed to modify data Data read permission: room calibration apps and third-party apps can read room calibration data Ensure that the Spatial Anchor Support and Scene Support checkboxes are checked in the YVRManager script. Note After checking the Spatial Anchor Support and Scene Support boxes, the anchor permissions are added to the AndroidManifest.xml file. <uses-permission android:name=\"com.yvr.permission.USE_ANCHOR_API\"\\> <uses-permission android:name=\"com.yvr.permission.USE_SCENE\"\\> com.yvr.permission.USE_SCENE is a runtime permission that allows the application to query spatial data on the user's device only when the user grants the permission. Requesting Android runtime permissions makes a permission request. Types of Components that can be included in Scene Anchors Scene Anchor requires components in order to describe a calibrated environment. Therefore, the app needs to obtain the spatial information contained in the anchor point by querying Scene Anchor if the given component is supported and if it is enabled or not. Locatable: A locatable component that informs the system that this locator can be tracked, and when enabled, the app can continuously query the positional information of the locator. Storable: Storable component, when enabled, it means the anchor point can be saved. RoomLayout: Room layout component that contains references to the wall, ceiling and floor anchors that make up the room. AnchorContainer: It contains references to a list of anchor points for other objects in the room (sofa, coffee table, windows, etc.). Bounded2D: Location point information for 2D planar data, containing the width and height of the plane and the offset relative to the x,y axis of the anchor point (or indexed triangle mesh for non-rectangular planes). Bounded3D: 3D cube data, containing the width, height and offset of the cube with respect to the x,y,z, axes of the anchor point. SemanticLabels: Semantic labels for the anchors, this component can categorize the anchors into multiple categories, read the following for details. Common Scene Anchor Points Scene anchor points for the room will have: RoomLayout component is used to reference the ceiling, walls and floor. AnchorContainer component is used to hold all the scene anchors in the room. Scene anchors for 2D elements (e.g. walls, ceilings, floors, windows, etc.): a Locatable component for the user to get the location of the anchor; a SemanticLabels semantic labelling component; and Boundary2D planar dimension data. Scene anchors for 3D elements (e.g. sofa, coffee table, table, etc.): a locatable component for the user to get the location of the anchor; a SemanticLabels semantic labeling component; and Bounded3D cube information. Semantic Classification of Anchors Semantic classification categorizes scene anchors into a predefined and systematically managed list of object types. Semantics segregate objects into their corresponding geometric descriptions in order to provide application developers with classification-specific game logic. Supported Semantic Tags: Semantic Type Description FLOOR Floor 2D CEILING Ceiling 2D WALL_FACE Wall face 2D COUCH Couch 3D DOOR_FRAME Door frame 2D WINDOW_FRAME Window frame 2D OTHER Others 3D TABLE Table 3D BED Bed 3D Note This list tab is evolving as we regularly add support for more 2D and 3D objects.

For the queried RoomLayout component anchor, get all the child anchors under the room calibration through YVRSceneAnchor.instance.GetAnchorContainer API. Loop through all child anchors using the YVRSpatialAnchor.instance.QuerySpatialAnchor API via the UUID. For a queried sub-anchor, call YVRSpatialAnchor.instance.GetSpatialAnchorComponentStatus to retrieve if it supports the corresponding component type If you want to know the dimensions, call GetAnchorBoundingBox2D, GetAnchorBoundary2D or GetAnchorBoundingBox3D to return the corresponding information and scale the Unity object accordingly.

YVRInput Usage The primary usage of YVRInput is to access controller input state through Get(), GetDown(), and GetUp(). It also sets the amplitude and duration of the controllers. Get(): Queries the current state of a controller. GetDown(): Queries whether a button(touch) was pressed in this frame. GetUp(): Queries whether a button(touch) was released this frame. SetControllerVibration(): Sets controller amplitude and its duration. Control Input Enumerations For Get(), GetDown(), and GetUp() functions, there are multiple variations to provide different access to different sets of controls. These sets of controls are divided into two categories: Virtual Mapping and Raw Mapping, and are all exposed through enumerations. The enumerations defined in Virtual Mapping categories are as follows: VirtualButton: Traditional buttons on YVR Touches. VirtualTouch: Capacitive-sensitive control surface on YVR Touches. VirtualAxis1D: One-dimensional controls that report a float state. VirtualAxis2D: Two-dimensional controls that report a Vector2 state.

It is divided into three parts: Part I: Static gestures, it ontains the recommended gestures and non-recommended gestures; Part II: Dynamic gestures, it describes the different hand movements; Part III: YVR system gestures, it is recommended that third-party applications avoid to use gestures that are similar to system gestures, not to be mistakenly triggered in the application. Static Gestures It is recommended to use a hand pose that can be done naturally and comfortably by the user, which is more ergonomic, and is also recommended at the level of gesture recognition: Hand pose with more visible features of the hand, i.e. hand pose where more hand features can be seen. It is recommended to use the right hand. Refer to the following image for illustration: Various twisted, chirpy, anti-human gestures are not recommended, as well as not recommended at the algorithmic level: Hand poses with fewer visible hand features, i.e. hand poses where more hand features cannot be seen. Hand poses with overlapping hands, such as crossed arms, are not recommended. Refer to the follow image for illustration (similar hand poses (left/right) are also not recommended): Dynamic Gestures Dynamic gestures can be understood as: static hand pose + time-keeping judgment. Therefore in combination with the recommendations for the use of static hand shapes, gestures with rapid movements are not recommended: Rapidly waving various hand poses, e.g. rapidly waving of palms, fists, etc. Rapidly turning various hand poses, e.g., rapidly rotating of the wrist, etc. Rapidly executing of dynamic gestures, e.g. rapid fist clenching, rapid pinching, etc. Rapid movement of various hand shapes, e.g. rapid movement of various hand poes in various directions System Gestures It is recommended to avoid using system gestures for app interactions. This prevents triggering the system menu by mistake. The current system includes the following system gestures: Initialize: Hand facing upwards, palm facing yourself Awake: Wrist area displaying system icon - Systen is awake Select Menu: Pinching gesture with hand movements to select the menu Release command: Hovering over the button, separates the index finger and thumb, the secondary menu fades out and only the function button is displayed (flashes for a certain amount of time and then disappears), and responds to its corresponding function."

    "keywords": "应用空间扭曲 应用空间扭曲（AppSW）是一种面向开发者的优化技术，允许应用以实际显示刷新率的一半进行渲染，从而为合适的内容释放额外的计算能力。据测试使用，AppSW 最高可为应用提供了70%的额外算力，而且几乎没有可感知的瑕疵。开发者在开发和设计阶段开启 AppSW 功能后，系统会基于应用内原始数据的运动矢量和深度信息进行帧外推和重投影，将一帧原始渲染图像自动合成多个新帧，以降低设备原始输出帧率、降低设备负载和功耗，最终突破算力限制，在 YVR 设备上实现接近 PCVR 更逼真、更优秀的画面表现。 环境要求 设备版本： YVR1 或 YVR2 SDK 版本： 2.4.0 及以上 系统版本 1.2.5.x 开启 AppSW 请参考以下步骤启用 AppSW 功能。 克隆 Unity-Graphics 仓库。在项目中导入以下三个 package.json 文件。从上方菜单栏处，选择 Window > Pacakge Manager > Add package from disk... 并安装以下软件包： Core RP Library Shader Graph Universal RP 如果使用自定义 shader，则需要在 AppSW 物体 Shader 中添加 Motion Vector Pass。 Note 如果使用 URP Lit 或 SimpleLit，则无需修改 Shader。 只有不透明的物体需要添加此 Motion Vector Pass，透明物体无需添加。 接近于不透明的物体(如 Alpha 接近于1)，也可以根据情况添加。 从上方菜单栏处，选择 Edit > Project Settings。在左侧栏，选择 Player > Android settings > Other Settings。在 Rendering 部分，将 Vulkan 添加至 Graphics APIs。 从上方菜单栏处，选择 Edit > Project Settings。 在左侧栏，选择 XR Plug-in Management > YVR，完成以下设置： 勾选 Use AppSW 在 Stereo Rendering Mode 里，选择 Multiview 输入以下代码启用 AppSW。 YVRManager.instance.SetAppSWEnable(true); 假设你应用的当前帧率为90帧，开启AppSW功能时，应用会以45帧渲染画面，但仍可以达到90帧的效果。若需要对比开启 AppSW + 45帧和关闭 AppSW + 45帧渲染的效果：在 YVR Manager 下，选择 Quality Manager > V Sync Count: K2 进行对比。 已知问题 在使用 AppSW 功能时，你的应用可能会出现一些渲染问题。请参考以下场景和说明来解决问题： 若场景内的背景十分简洁，并且包含直线、网格等元素，AppSW 可能会导致图像失真，例如：直线扭曲。若出现图像失真情况，可不断进行调试并调整背景，直到达到满意的效果。 若场景内包含一些高速旋转的物体，开启 AppSW 后，物体周围可能会出现失真伪影，可通过降低物体的旋转速度来解决该问题。 若场景中个别元素有意外停顿或画面上有波纹，这一般是因为运动矢量的数据不够准确，具体原因为： 如果运动矢量缓冲区没有显示场景中移动部分的运动，就会造成停顿，因为移动的物体在合成帧中似乎保持在原地。 如果运动矢量缓冲区显示场景中不动的部分有运动，就会产生波纹，因为静止的物体在合成帧中会发生移动。"

    "title": "合成层 | Core",
    "keywords": "合成层 合成层（Composition Layers）可以将所有需要展示的物体进行分割，以达到诸如提高特定对象清晰度的目的。在最传统的渲染模式下，场景内所有的物体都将被渲染至同一张纹理（Eye Buffer）中，该纹理将由系统进行 ATW、畸变、合成等处理并最终显示在设备屏幕上。我们可以通过合成层技术，将场景内的特定对象渲染至一张纹理上，并将该纹理直接交由系统进行合成，因此减少了一次额外的纹理采样，提高了物体渲染的清晰度。 需要注意的是，合成层并非万能的，每一个合成层对于系统而言都会增加合成的开销，因此在使用合成层时，需要根据实际需求和设备性能进行合理的使用： 建议将合成层用于需要提高清晰度的物体上，例如 UI 界面、文字等。 合成层的数量不宜过多，一般情况下，单个场景的合成层数量控制在 4 层左右即可。 合成层的深度值需要合理设置，以确保合成层和 Eye Buffer 中的内容不会引发错误的遮挡效果。 合成层类型 将合成层根据类型划分可分为 Overlay 和 Underlay 两种类型： Overlay：Overlay 类型的合成层将纹理呈现在 Eye Buffer 前面，默认为该选项。对于需要始终出现在 Eye Buffer 前面的物体，如光标，可以使用 Overlay 类型的合成层。 Underlay：Underlay 类型的合成层将纹理呈现在 Eye Buffer 后面。由于 Underlay 层依赖于渲染目标上的 alpha 通道。场景中的所有对象绘制到 Eye Buffer 后，你需要在 Eye Buffer 上构建一个 “洞”，使 Underlay 纹理透过这个 “洞” 显示出来。类似 UI 界面这样的物体，可能会被 Eye Buffer 内的其他物体所遮挡（如 UI 被手柄遮挡），此时可以使用 Underlay 类型的合成层。 可通过 compostion depth 来区分 Overlay 和 Underlay 类型的合成层： Eye Buffer 的深度值为 0。 Underlay 类型的合成层深度值小于 0。 Overlay 类型的合成层深度值大于 0。 合成层形状 合成层的形状决定了合成层的展示效果。合成层的形状有三种：Quad、Cylinder 和 Equirect： Quad：具有四个顶点的四边形平面纹理，通常用来显示场景中的文本或信息。 Cylinder：具有柱面弧度的圆柱形纹理，通常用于显示曲面 UI 界面。若使用 Cylinder，则： Transform 中心将作为 Cylinder 的中心，Transform 的尺寸将作为 Cylinder 的尺寸，且 Cylinder 中 Transform 的尺寸均为全局尺寸（Global Scale）。其中，Z 作为 Cylinder 的半径，Y 作为 Cylinder 的高，X/Z 作为 Cylinder 的弧长。 必须将摄像机放置在圆柱内切球内。如果摄像机接近内切球表面，合成层将无法显示。 Equirect：球体纹理，通常用于显示 360/180 全景纹理。 Radius 参数用于指定圆柱的半径，当设置为 0 或者正无限大（1.0f/0.0f）时，表示无限大的半径。球面半径无限大时，其展示效果如同空场景中的天空盒。 Destination Rects 下的 X 参数无用；W 参数映射到中心角，关于中心点坐标 (0, 0) 对称。 纹理类型 合成层处理的对象为纹理，纹理类型可分为三种： 外部纹理：纹理内容是从 Unity 的渲染上下文外获取。在通常的使用案例下，为 Android Surface 直接获取纹理（例如：Android 播放器视频纹理），对于视频播放器等场景，需要使用外部纹理。 动态纹理：纹理内容在运行时会发生更新，例如：摄像机生成的 RenderTexture 图片。 静态纹理：纹理内容在运行时不会发生更新，如场景中的静态广告图片。 纹理 针对使用在合成层上的纹理，可以有以下的设置： Texture Rects 勾选 Texture Rects 选框后，可配置 Source Rects 和 Destination Rects 相关参数。 若选择自定义 Source Rects 和 Destination Rects（即选择 Custom 选项），则需确保 X、Y、W、H 的值位于指定区间内：X：\\([0,1)\\)、Y：\\([0,1)\\)、W：\\((0,1]\\)、H：\\((0,1]\\)。 透明度 alpha 参数用于设置纹理的透明度，取值范围为 \\([0,1]\\)。 示例 CompositeLayer 场景是用来说明合成层效果的。合成层的设计是为了提高平面 UI 的清晰度。在传统的渲染管道中，UI 纹理必须首先被渲染到 Unity 管理的颜色缓冲区，然后 Unity 管理的颜色缓冲区将被渲染到屏幕缓冲区。而使用合成层时，目标 UI 纹理可以直接由本地渲染。因此，可以减少由采样引起的失真。 在 YVR 设备上运行 CompositeLayer 场景时的屏幕截图如下： Caution 由于合成层是由 YVR 设备的原生系统渲染的，所以内容不能在 Unity 编辑器中显示。 下面的部分是由 Unity Eye Buffer 渲染的界面，上面的部分是用合成层渲染的。左边的部分是动态纹理，右边的部分是静态纹理。 使用合成层（上部）和 Unity Eye Buffer（下部）渲染的详细区别如下： Caution 在细节图像中可以看到一些色散，这是为抵消镜头造成的色散而产生的。因此，在使用设备时，不会看到所有的色散. 合成层示例 请参考以下示例项目。 打开一个新项目或当前项目。 导入最新版 SDK。 在 Project 面板下，选择 Pacakages > YVR Core > Scenes > CompositeLayer。 在 CompositeLayer 文件夹中，选择 CompositeLayer.unity 打开该场景。 在 File > Build Settings... 下，选择 Add Open Scenes。 选择 Build 并为文件命名。 在设备上安装 APK 文件。 该场景显示不同深度值遮挡效果、动态和静态图像的效果。 图形雨矩形示例 请参考以下示例项目。 打开一个新项目或当前项目。 导入最新版 SDK。 在 Project 面板下，选择 Pacakages > YVR Core > Scenes > CompositeLayer。 在 CompositeLayer 文件夹中，选择 CompositeLayerShapeAndRect.unity 打开该场景。 在 File > Build Settings... 下，选择 Add Open Scenes。 选择 Build 并为文件命名。 在设备上安装 APK 文件。 该场景显示形状切换、设置源矩形和目标矩形的效果。 Underlay vs Overlay 由于原生系统需要对多个图层进行合成，因此需要知道所有图层的顺序。这个顺序是由合成层的深度决定的，Unity Eye Buffer 的深度被设置为 0。而所有深度大于 0 的层被称为 Overlay，而深度小于 0 的层被称为 Underlay。 底层将首先被绘制，然后是 Unity Eye Buffer，最后是 Overlay。因此，Unity Eye Buffer 将覆盖 Underlay，而 Overlay 将覆盖 Eye Buffer。 为了让 Underlay 正常显示，而不是被完全覆盖，需要在 Unity Eye Buffer 中开一个孔。着色器 YVR/UnderlayPuncher 被设计用来生成这样的孔： Tip 示例场景中左上角的图层是 Underlay。"
